This is a game engine I made for a game I was working on.  The game (or at least something like it)
may exist some day, but this engine is probably going nowhere.  I learned a lot by making this, so
maybe you can learn something from looking at it.  It requires some assets in the `/assets` directory.
I can provide them upon request.  Probably.
